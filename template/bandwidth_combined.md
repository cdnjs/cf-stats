> Another great stat that Cloudflare has given us again is the bandwidth usage for the cdnjs.cloudflare.com domain.
> 
> This number, like total requests, is provided at a 1% sample for the month and in gigabytes: {{BANDWIDTH_1_PER}} GB.\
> This is {{BANDWIDTH_1_PER_TOTAL_GB}} GB or {{BANDWIDTH_1_PER_TOTAL_PB}} PB when multiplied up to be 100%.
> 
> Additionally, a 3 day 100% sample is given by Cloudflare at {{BANDWIDTH_3_DAY}} GB.\
> This results in {{BANDWIDTH_3_DAY_TOTAL_GB}} GB or {{BANDWIDTH_3_DAY_TOTAL_PB}} PB for the month.

As with the total number of requests and due to the significant difference between the two, both numbers will be used to
 calculate an average for the final estimate of bandwidth consumed this month (75%: 1% month sample data, 25%: 100% 3
 day data).\
This produces the estimate of {{BANDWIDTH_GB}} GB of bandwidth used for this month by cdnjs.
