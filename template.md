## Total number of requests

> The first important stat that we are given is the total number of requests sent to cdnjs.cloudflare.com.
> 
> Cloudflare provides this number to us at a 1% sample for the whole month, giving {{REQUESTS_1_PER}} at 1%.\
> This is {{REQUESTS_1_PER_TOTAL}} when multiplied up to 100%.
> 
> We are also given a number of requests for 3 days at a 100% sample, which is {{REQUESTS_3_DAY}}.\
> This is {{REQUESTS_3_DAY_TOTAL}} when recalculated for the {{DAYS}} days of {{MONTH}}.

To provide the best possible estimate for the entire month, an average of both numbers will be used to generate the
 estimate for the final number of requests for the month (75%: 1% month sample data, 25%: 100% 3 day data).\
This results in cdnjs serving approximately {{REQUESTS}} requests in {{MONTH}}.

## Websites using cdnjs

> The second great stat that we get each month from Cloudflare is the number of websites using cdnjs.cloudflare.com.
> 
> Part of the logging data kept is the headers for requests made to the subdomain, so we can use this to estimate the
>  number of websites that have been using cdnjs for their resources in the last month, based on the number of unique
>  subdomains presented in the Referer request header. This data can only really be considered with the 1% month
>  sample, as there is no good way to extrapolate from a 100% 3 day sample to the entire month.
>
> Cloudflare gave this number at a 1% sample with {{SITES_1_PER}} unique subdomains having made requests to
>  cdnjs.cloudflare.com.

Scaling this up to a rough estimate at 100% for the {{DAYS}} days of {{MONTH}}, we can approximate that {{SITES}} unique
 subdomains, or websites, made requests for resources from cdnjs.cloudflare.com this month.

## Total bandwidth usage

> Another great stat that Cloudflare has given us again is the bandwidth usage for the cdnjs.cloudflare.com domain.
> 
> This number, like total requests, is provided at a 1% sample for the month and in gigabytes: {{BANDWIDTH_1_PER}} GB.\
> This is {{BANDWIDTH_1_PER_TOTAL_GB}} GB or {{BANDWIDTH_1_PER_TOTAL_PB}} PB when multiplied up to be 100%.
> 
> Additionally, a 3 day 100% sample is given by Cloudflare at {{BANDWIDTH_3_DAY}} GB.\
> This results in {{BANDWIDTH_3_DAY_TOTAL_GB}} GB or {{BANDWIDTH_3_DAY_TOTAL_PB}} PB for the month.

As with the total number of requests and due to the significant difference between the two, both numbers will be used to
 calculate an average for the final estimate of bandwidth consumed this month (75%: 1% month sample data, 25%: 100% 3
 day data).\
This produces the estimate of {{BANDWIDTH_GB}} GB of bandwidth used for this month by cdnjs.

## Top 100 requested resources

> These are provided at a 1% sample for the whole of {{MONTH}}.
> Bandwidth is measured in gigabytes.
> This data, as well as previous months' data, is available in the SQLite data.db file.
